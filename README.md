# UNICODA

**UNICODA** is an experiment in constraint-based communication - an archive of untranslatable thoughts and concepts constructed entirely from Unicode symbols, logic operators and gradient blocks.

The project charts these symbolic expressions across three distinct formats:
*   **Barcodes:** Dense, single-line concepts resembling data tapes.
*   **Currents:** Narrative flows that chart a protagonist's journey.
*   **Geodes:** Vertical directory paths that drill down onto a concept or thoughts.

Built as a lightweight, zero-dependency application using vanilla JavaScript, it features a custom procedural ASCII shader engine (`backdrop.js`) and a desktop-class window manager for annotations (`annotations.js`).

*Vibecoded by **Naym** with the aid of **Gemini 3.0 Pro** and **Claude Sonnet 4.5**.*
